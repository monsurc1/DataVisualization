# DataVisualization
This project is all about investigating and visualizing gross domestic product (GDP) related to data in Switzerland.

I have used Matplotlib and Plotly with dash packages to give it a boost in data visualization tasks.

There are 2 code files which were used to make the presentation/visualization.

Thank you for your interest in my project.
