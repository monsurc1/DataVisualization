A country's GDP can be determined using a variety of methods, including the expenditure technique. The expenditure
approach calculates GDP as the total of all purchases of goods and services made within a country's boundaries during a given time period, usually a year, by households, corporations, governments, and foreign entities.

I have chosen the expenditure approach. The expenditure approach can be broken down into four main components:
  • Consumer spending (C): This includes all expenditures made by households on final goods and services, such as food, clothing, housing, and healthcare.
  • Investment spending (I): This includes all expenditures made by businesses on capital goods such as machinery, equipment, and buildings, as well as inventory investment.
  • Government spending (G): This includes all expenditures made by government entities on goods and services, such as defense, education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
• Net exports (NX): This is the difference between a country's exports and imports, representing the net amount of goods and services sold to foreign entities.

The GDP of a country can be calculated using the following formula:
GDP = C + I + G + NX
NX = Exp - Imp
